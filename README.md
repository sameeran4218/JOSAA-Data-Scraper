A JOSAA data scraper which extracts the institute name, round,year,branch,gender,quota,seat type,opening rank and closing rank based on user input.
We implement Selenium to interact with the form and enter details provided by the user.
We then use BeautifulSoup to scrape all the necessary data from the webpage like institute,gender,opening rank and closing rank.
Finally we use Pandas to create a dataframe of the extracted data and save it to a csv file.
